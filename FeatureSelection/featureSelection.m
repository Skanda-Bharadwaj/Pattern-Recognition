%% Feature Selection
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features 
% for use in model construction. This script addressess two major feature 
% selection methods âˆ’ Filter and Wrapper. While the filter method ranks the 
% features based on some discriminative power, wrappers use a search algorithm 
% to search through the space of possible features and evaluate each subset 
% by running a model on the subset.

% countfeat is a Mx2 matrix that keeps track of how many times a feature has 
% been selected, where M is the dimension of the original feature space.
% The first column of this matrix records how many times a feature has ranked 
% within top 1% during 100 times of feature ranking. The second column of 
% this matrix records how many times a feature was selected by forward feature 
% selection during 100 times.
