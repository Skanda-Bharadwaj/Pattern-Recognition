Experiments of Pattern Recognition:

	Curve Fitting/Linear Regression (SSE, Maximum Likelihood, MAP)
	Supervised Classifiers (Linear Discriminant Analysis(Fisher's Projection), K-class Discriminant, KNN)
	Feature Selection (Filter, Wrapper and Filtrapper)
	Basics of Deep Learning (Building own network from scratch)
	Trying to build R-CNN (All steps independently)
